# Stock_News-Analyze
Analysing stocks based on their historical data. And trying machine learning (or AI) to analyse news headline (maybe more) to get warnings for invested stocks.

# Idea Collection
## Idea 1 to make a simple AI
We try to remove all stop-words from all the Strings we have and convert those Strings into 
numbers. When we have all the strings in numbers we can calculate with those strings more 
easily (like using k-means clustering or so).


# Analyze Collection
## Status 07.02.2023
Collecting News Headlines via GoogleNews for around 550 companies once a day and saving this 
data to a csv, one for each company.
